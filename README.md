# EmployeeApp

This is a simple C# .NET console application that demonstrates:

- Defining an interface (`IQuittable`) with a `Quit()` method.
- Implementing that interface in a concrete class (`Employee`).
- Using polymorphism (an object referenced by its interface type).
- Overloading `==` and `!=` operators to compare Employees by `Id`.
- Thorough inline comments explaining each line / block.
